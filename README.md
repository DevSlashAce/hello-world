Getting started with GitHub's Hello World project.

Hello World!

My name is Miguel.  I'm a self taught coder working on expanding my knowledge into the software development world. 

Myjourney began when I was about 7 years old by learning BASIC programming language from a book that accompanied a Radio Shack Tandy TRS-80 Color that I borrowed from my cousin.  I first started by working through the projects that were included with the book and later graduated to creating quizzers to help me study for my classes.

Later in life, around the early 2000s, I was exposed to Python programming language although I never continued with it beyond that one class I took.  A few years later I learned HTML and CSS where I created a few simple webpages that were hosted for one of our local non-profit organizations.

Fast forwarding to the present, I'm finally at a place where I can take what I have learned and start learning new tools such as GitHub and other programming languages that will help me grow throughout my software develoer journey.
